# Will AI replace humans? A Marxist analysis.

Ashley MERIENNE __|__ *2025-03-13*


## Current situation

We are currently seeing multiple fields and jobs being replaced by AI already,
like trading and logistics.

Other fields, such as IT or manufacturing, are seeing their productivity multiplied.

This is the sign of AI being a very powerful tool to speed up and / or automate
tasks, notably at work.

So, is AI a threat? Will it replace us?


## Analysis

I believe that AI will replace most humans at their jobs, yes. I believe that it is currently
a threat, but I do not believe it is a threat in itself.

__Allow me to explain :__


### Economy

First of all, let me say that AI relies on data and information, that needs to be produced by
humans, meaning, AI cannot replace all jobs and professions. Similarly, AI cannot feel emotions,
and I do not 

A gain in productivity with AI tools will be inevitable and massive. These are (in theory),
great news. But, we live in a capitalist society :

Let's say you have a 200% productivity boost thanks to a new integrated AI in some of the
tools at your company. Instead of asking you to work 50% less hours, your company will fire
50% of their employees, and keep more money, or, you know it, give more money to shareholders.

That's explained by the companies seeking always more and more added value.

The bigger problem with this tendency to have massive layoffs is that, if most companies do it,
eventually you run into a big problem : too much productivity gain results in breaking one of 
capitalism's contradictions...


### AI Crash?

Too much layoffs creates large increases in unemployment and results in a market crash :

- Unemployment makes you poor and a *"bad"* consumer in a capitalist society : you buy less
- Massive unemployment results in a large decrease in demand on the market

This decrease can result in a market crash :
The means of production, the workers, and the primary resources are there, but production
is halted, similarly to the 1930s.

That is precisely why I believe AI is a threat right now. Now let me show you why it isn't a
threat in ***itself***.


### Avoid the crash?

As you know, AI right now is simply a way to automate certain tasks and / or jobs, and to boost
productivity in certain other jobs.

However,
